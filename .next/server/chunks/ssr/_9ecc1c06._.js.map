By not dominating, the Master leads.\" }\n      ]\n    const dayOfYear = Math.floor((Date.now() - Date.parse('2025-01-01')) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));\n    const chapterIndex = dayOfYear % 81;\n    return chapters[chapterIndex] || { number: 0, title: 'Not Found', text: 'Chapter not available yet.' };\n  }"],"names":[],"mappings":";;;AAMS,eAAe;IACpB,MAAM,WAAsB;QACxB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAG,SAAS;YAAK,QAAQ;QAAua;QAC5c;YAAE,UAAU;YAAG,SAAS;YAAK,QAAQ;QAAwlB;QAC7nB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAG,SAAS;YAAK,QAAQ;QAA4Z;QACjc;YAAE,UAAU;YAAG,SAAS;YAAK,QAAQ;QAA6M;QAClP;YAAE,UAAU;YAAG,SAAS;YAAK,QAAQ;QAA4T;QACjW;YAAE,UAAU;YAAG,SAAS;YAAK,QAAQ;QAAoK;QACzM;YAAE,UAAU;YAAG,SAAS;YAAK,QAAQ;QAAuW;QAC5Y;YAAE,UAAU;YAAG,SAAS;YAAK,QAAQ;QAAud;QAC5f;YAAE,UAAU;YAAG,SAAS;YAAK,QAAQ;QAAuR;QAC5T;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAojB;QAC3lB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAgT;QACvV;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAqP;QAC5R;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAmkB;QAC1mB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAge;QACvgB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAinB;QACxpB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA0iB;QACjlB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAmV;QAC1X;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA4P;QACnS;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA6T;QACpW;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA2vB;QAClyB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAiZ;QACxb;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA2kB;QAClnB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAwjB;QAC/lB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAmW;QAC1Y;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAihB;QACxjB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAwY;QAC/a;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAwjB;QAC/lB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAiqB;QACxsB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA2iB;QACllB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAkkB;QACzmB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA2lB;QACloB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA8gB;QACrjB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAwR;QAC/T;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA8a;QACrd;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA6b;QACpe;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA4Y;QACnb;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAiV;QACxX;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAq1B;QAC53B;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA6iB;QACplB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA+H;QACtK;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAiqB;QACxsB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAkX;QACzZ;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA0P;QACjS;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAua;QAC9c;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAuU;QAC9W;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAqW;QAC5Y;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA+P;QACtS;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAwV;QAC/X;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA6Z;QACpc;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA6X;QACpa;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA+f;QACtiB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAqgB;QAC5iB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAqT;QAC5V;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA4f;QACniB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA6hB;QACpkB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAqX;QAC5Z;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAwmB;QAC/oB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAkiB;QACzkB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAoY;QAC3a;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAyR;QAChU;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAgqB;QACvsB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA4hB;QACnkB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAoZ;QAC3b;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAqyB;QAC50B;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA0a;QACjd;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAkc;QACze;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAqjB;QAC5lB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA0X;QACja;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA8gB;QACrjB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAqR;QAC5T;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAoO;QAC3Q;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAmR;QAC1T;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA4P;QACnS;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAgU;QACvW;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAyK;QAChN;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAwT;QAC/V;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAomB;QAC3oB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA8a;QACrd;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAoO;QAC3Q;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAAugB;QAC9iB;YAAE,UAAU;YAAI,SAAS;YAAM,QAAQ;QAA2V;KACnY;IACH,MAAM,YAAY,KAAK,KAAK,CAAC,CAAC,KAAK,GAAG,KAAK,KAAK,KAAK,CAAC,aAAa,IAAI,CAAC,OAAO,KAAK,KAAK,EAAE;IAC3F,MAAM,eAAe,YAAY;IACjC,OAAO,QAAQ,CAAC,aAAa,IAAI;QAAE,QAAQ;QAAG,OAAO;QAAa,MAAM;IAA6B;AACvG","debugId":null}},
